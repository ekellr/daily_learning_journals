# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

My Journal is being rocky, but I am sure I will pull out of it. I am looking forward to finish all my labs tonight and if i have time, to resubmite the ones i did not get 100% right.

I am still adapting with this class format and I hopefully i will have everything up to date for tomorrow pair programming.

I might update this file later once I finish my labs.
