# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

There were a lot of going on in those last few days of class. I am working really hard to mantain myself calm and finish my assignments. There is so much to do and resubmit that my ad is spinning and I am still overwhelmed, but i believe I will finish it all soon.

Best part of my learning:

- Pair programming on Friday with Roscoe.
- Design is my favorite part and I wish we had more time to make the chocolate pizza page.
- I had a great talk with Elizabeth. I believe my talk with her was way more productive than with Sasha and Fuzz. I felt more confortable talking to her.
