# LJ Code 201 - Day 1


Today I learned more deeply how git.bash and gitHub work. It was a different experience for me since I am used to Putty and WinSCP to manipulate and do stuff around UNIX. I had a lot of trouble following the class because I got lost in one command and everything went down hill pretty fast.

It was frustrating when things did not work properly and I could not find a way to make my git files to work. I work together with my peer and we both struggled to understand the class material. We both felt the instructor moved through the material too quickly. When I asked for a link to today's recording, the link that was posted on the slack group did not contain the recording, further adding to my frustration and stress level.

I am glad that after a few hours worrying about organizing all my files and folders, I just decided to delete everything and start from scratch. That helped me a lot to practice in the terminal.


###List of cool things:

* how repository works
* .md files syntex style (I am using this *here*)
* add links to this file like i did below

This is the link to my daily-learning-journals GitHub page.
