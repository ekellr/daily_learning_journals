# LJ Code 201 - Day 1


##Today I learned more deeply how git.bash and gitHub work. It was a different experience for me since I am used to Putty and WinSCP to manipulate and do stuff around UNIX. I had a lot of trouble following the class because I got lost in one command and everything went down hill pretty fast.
##I am glad that after a few hours worrying about organizing all my files and folders, I just decided to delete everything and start from scratch. That helped me a lot to practice in the terminal

###List of cool things:

* how repository works
* .md files syntex style (I am using this *here*)
