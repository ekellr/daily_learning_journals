# LJ Code 201 - Day 3


From the pas few days I learned more git commands. Fixed and broken a bunch of branches, but I hope i can do stuff at the repository without trouble

Read 4 chapters of HTML and CSS book and 5 chapters of JavaScript & JQuery.

I am strugling a lot with this class, not because I do not know the material, but the lack of planning and structure. I have ADHD and anxiety, which is making extremely hard for me to follow this class.


#List of cool things:

* Practice functions, I love working with them.
* DOM
* Constructions
