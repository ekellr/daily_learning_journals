#LJ Code 201 - Day 6

I am taking a day at a time. To be honest, nothing really changed for me yet. s I mentioned before, the pace of this class is too much for me and I am taking my time to have things done because the more a push myself, the less productive I become. I am doing my best according to my abilities, and I hope my anxiety gets better, so I can think straight and finish my tasks.


##Best Parts

- I totally love working on the User Stories
- Wish we had time to work on user scenarios
- Had a wonderful conversation with Stephanie
- Really enjoy reading the books
