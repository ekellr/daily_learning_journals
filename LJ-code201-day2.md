# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today I learned a lot!!! First started the day doing the code review with three other students. 
It was very nice to see their code and realize that each one of us had a total different way to write it.

Later I learned in classe more cool material of HTML (new tags), create functions, and how to insert picstires and formatt the css file
The best experience of the day was the pair programming with my peer Daniel. 

##I learned:

* How to debug from the website source.
* How to properly create a branch and fork through git
* Fork each other's folders
* He helped each other to debugg and create new functions

Overall, today was a day that I learned the most since the beginning of the class 201 :)
